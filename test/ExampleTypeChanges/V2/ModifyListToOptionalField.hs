-- Warnings for this change from Base type:
--
-- data List Int
--
-- We're expecting an entirely different request type. This will break old versions of clients. Consider making this change in a couple of steps to avoid failures: First, add a new endpoint using the new type. Then migrate clients over to use the new endpoint. Finally remove the old endpoint when it is no longer used.
